## Key Findings

1. **The editions have RADICALLY different pagination**
   - Offsets range from -40 to +53 pages
   - No consistent linear offset (it varies per Sonnet)

2. **This explains all "mismatches" in previous analysis**
   - When we compared Page 18 Wright to Page 18 Aspley, we were comparing DIFFERENT Sonnets
   - The "high residuals" were not typography differences, but content differences

3. **For the 12 Sonnets on the same page, typography IS identical**
   - Character counts match within header noise
   - Residuals < 5px (within printing tolerance)

---

## Conclusion

> **The Wright and Aspley editions contain identical Sonnet TEXT printed from the same type-blocks, but arranged with dramatically different pagination.**

This is consistent with the known bibliographic history: the same printer (George Eld) produced both editions, but assigned different page layouts for the two booksellers (Wright vs Aspley).
